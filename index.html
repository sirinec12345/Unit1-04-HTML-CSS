  <center><h1> Nomophobia . . . The Obscure Pandemic </h1></center>
  <script src="script.js"></script>

   <h2> Introduction </h2>
  <p>Nomophobia is a term that refers to the fear or worry of being without a cell phone or not being able to use it. This term is formed from the contraction of the expression ''no mobile phone phobia.'' The symptoms are manifested by a state of anguish, anxiety and an impossibility to regulate its use. As a result, this behavior can lead to loss of social connections, sleep/appetite disturbances or even depression.</p>

  <h2> Context </h2>
  <p>The use of cell phones has grown exponentially in recent years. In fact, this correlation was especially seen after the upgrade of smart devices. In other words, cell phones are now our companions for work, social life, leisure and even family life. However, excessive consumption can lead to addiction and self-esteem issues which in turn lead to a phobia.</p>

  <h2> Causes </h2>
  <p> Several factors are linked to the presence of nomophobia among our population; however, easy access to our cell phones and connectivity are the main factors which encourages attachment to these devices. Currently, approximately 80% of the world's population owns one of these devices, compared to 3.67 billion in 2016. In addition, individuals who have psychological and emotional problems such as depression, loneliness, social anxiety, impulsiveness and absent-mindedness are more susceptible to nomophobia.</p>

  <h2> Consequences </h2>
  <p>The most common psychological consequences of nomophobia are anxiety, depression, and isolation. Mobile phones are believed to allow us to stay in touch with others, but the problem arises when online relationships replace face-to-face relationships. In addition, there are also physical consequences such as headaches, stomach aches, eye pain due to overexposure to the screen, or even wrist and neck pain due to poor adjustment.</p>

  <h2> Solutions </h2>
  <p>There are several useful solutions and tips that can be used to combat nomophobia. For example, features on your cell phone like airplane mode, disabling notifications, silent mode, black and white mode, can make it less appealing. In addition, it is recommended to avoid using your phone as an alarm, to leave it at home before going out, and to be aware of the time spent on each application by clicking on the usage settings. Also, if these techniques are not helpful, you could talk to a therapist or online support agencies (Kids Help Phone, Red Cross, ConnexOntario, etc.).</p>
